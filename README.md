# AES ELITE


The goal- make the best cli AES encryption app possible that is easiest to use and is the most secure, and make it password based. 

usage ./[whatever you named the app] [input file]

encrypts the file in place (overwrites it) 

In memory processing only for reliability. Modern machines have plenty of ram. 




The strongest encryption possible. As a demo, make a file called test.html with all "a" charachters like aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa  

then encrypt the file using the password "a"  and open the file in any web browser  and you will be able to see that the  encrypted file will be incredibly random. 

That is the WORST case - just one char as the password. So imagine how good it will encrypt with a proper password!!
